        <h1>Grain</h1>
        <p>
            The 4th and final texture is the <b>Grain</b> background. Full transparency, I definitely needed a layup for this last one. Mainly cause I'd overcompensated on the previous textures and the steps to produce them. I needed something that was gonna be aesthetically still pleasing, but much, much more simple to produce. 
        </p>
        <h3>Let's get started</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                We'll begin with creating a canvas that measures 1000 x 1000 pixels. This will allow us to create more density at better quality.
            </li>
            <li>
                Let's cover the entire canvas with a rectangle and fill the color with the following hexcode.
                <br><br>
                <table>
                    <thead>
                        <tr>
                            <td style="background-color: #444440; color: #ffffff; border: 2px solid white;"> e7ce12 </td>
                        </tr>
                    </thead>
                </table>
                <br>
            </li>
            <li>
                Next up is actually creating the texture. Create a new layer and head up to the menu selecting:
                <br><br>
                <b style="color:#a10fc5;">Edit > Fill > Contents > Select 50% Gray</b>
                <br><br>
            </li>
            <li>
                Let's convert the gray layer to a smart object
            </li>
            <li>
                Head up to the filters menu and select:
                <br><br>
                <b style="color: #a10fc5;">
                Filter > Noise > Add Noise
                </b>
                <br><br>
                I set my amount to about 9% under gaussian and monocrhomatic
            </li>
            <li>
                Now that we have the noise, let's change the blend mode to color burn
            </li>
            <li>
                Our final step is exporting that puppy and dropping it into the img folder because it's CSS ready. 
            </li>
        </ul>
