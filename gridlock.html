            <h1>Gridlock</h1>
            <p>
                For the <b>gridlock background</b>, my goal was to create linear pathways outside of a traditional square grid. <b>Repetition</b> was key but, most importantly was achieving seamlessness. Below are the steps we took in order to create this background! 
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Begin by creating a photoshop document that measures 400 pixels by 400 pixels 
                </li>
                <li>
                    You'll want to add guides to create quadrants to have everything lined up for repetition. 
                    <br> <br>
                    Click <b>View > New Guide Layout</b>
                    <br><br>
                    <img src="img/guide2x2.png" alt="Guide layout settings" width="300">
                </li>
                <br>
                <li> 
                    The guides have setup 4 quadrants. Using the <b>Shape Tool (U)</b> begin assembling a grid of 6 x 6 squares in the top left quadrant with each square measuring about 15 pixels. 
                    <br><br>
                    What you end up with should look like a square made up of smaller, tinier squares
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    From here, we'll want to create a smart object that will house all of our squares into one clean editable, non-destructive layer. To do this, group all of the squares together by selecting their individual layers and placing them in a folder using Ctrl+G. You can now right-click and select "Create Smart Object"
                </li>
        <br><br>
                <li>
                    With the smart object selected, select the fx icon and add a Gradient Overlay. This will open the <b>fx</b> tab where you can select and manipulate the 					gradient. There's a preset gradient that we'll be using to recreate							<b>Gridlock</b>:
        <br><br>
                <ul> 
                    <li>The blend mode will be <b>soft light</b></li>
                    <li>Select preset <b>Green 24</b> change the gradient style to radial</li>
                    <li>Check the <b>Reverse</b> box</li>
                    <li>Change the style to <b>Radial</b></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        <br><br>
                <li>
                We'll flesh out some of the empty space with smaller clusters. we'll take the same 36-cluster and duplicate it to where the corner just peeks out with 6 squares from the top left corner and the bottom right corner. 
                </li>
                <br>
                <img src="img/clusters.png" title="Image example of how the clusters should look" alt="Sample of how the clusters should look" width="300">
                <br> <br>
                <li>
                    Lastly, we just need to add the background. For this, create a solid color from the <b>adjustments</b> menu and enter the hexcode #305b40. From here we can export as a .PNG and add it to our background in the styles!
                </li>
            </ul>
